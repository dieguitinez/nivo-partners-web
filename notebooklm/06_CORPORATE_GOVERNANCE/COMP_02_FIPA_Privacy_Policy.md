# INTERNAL DATA PRIVACY POLICY (FIPA COMPLIANT)

**Compliance Standard**: Florida Information Protection Act (FIPA) - Section 501.171, Florida Statutes.

## 1. PURPOSE & SCOPE

This policy defines how Nivo Partners LLC ("the Firm") protects "Personal Information" (PI) of clients and partners. Under FIPA, PI includes names combined with SSNs, driver's license numbers, or financial account information.

## 2. DATA PROTECTION PROTOCOLS

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized personnel with a legitimate business need may access PI.
- **Zero-Storage Principle**: Nivo Partners avoids storing sensitive financial PI (e.g., credit cards) on its own servers, utilizing specialized SOC2-compliant third-party processors.

## 3. BREACH NOTIFICATION (FIPA REQUIREMENTS)

In the event of a suspected or confirmed data breach, the following timeline must be followed:

- **Notification to Affected Individuals**: Mandatory if the breach is likely to result in financial harm. Must be sent as soon as possible, but no later than **30 days** after determination of the breach.
- **Notification to Department of Legal Affairs**: If a breach affects more than **500 individuals**, the Florida Department of Legal Affairs must be notified within 30 days.

## 4. DATA DISPOSAL

The Firm shall take all reasonable measures to dispose of records containing PI by shredding, erasing, or otherwise modifying the information to make it unreadable or indecipherable.

## 5. REVENUE CORE INTERACTION

Data processed through the "Revenue Core" engines must be sanitized. No PII is to be used for model training as per the `GOV_03_Ethical_AI_Charter`.

**ENFORCEMENT**: Failure to adhere to this policy may result in disciplinary action and potential exposure to FIPA penalties of up to $500,000 for non-compliance.
