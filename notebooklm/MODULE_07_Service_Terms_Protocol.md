# MODULE_07: Service Terms & Protocols

## 1. Service Nature: The Simplicity Protocol

Nivo Partners operates under the **"Simplicity Protocol"**, a proprietary methodology for high-velocity B2B infrastructure deployment. We act as a fractional technology partner ("Agency Mode"), not as employees.

## 2. Intellectual Property & Sovereignty

**Client Assets:** You retain 100% ownership of all "Results" (SQL databases, lead lists, campaign metrics).

**Nivo IP:** We retain exclusive ownership of the "Engine" (including Python scrapers, "Kai" persona logic, and codebase patterns). Grant of license is for deployment only.

## 3. AI Liability & "Hallucinations"

Our infrastructure utilizes generative AI. While we engineer for precision, AI models may produce factual anomalies ("hallucinations"). Nivo Partners disclaims liability for business decisions made solely on unverified AI output.

*"Trust but Verify."* The Client is responsible for final data validation before execution.

## 4. Jurisdiction

Governed by the laws of **Hillsborough County, Florida**. Arbitration required for disputes under $25,000.
