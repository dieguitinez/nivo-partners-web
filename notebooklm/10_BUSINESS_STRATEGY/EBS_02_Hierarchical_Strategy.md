## 🚀 MVP #1: Project TRINITY-ALPHA

*We merge Rank 1 and Rank 2 for a "Hybrid Alpha" launch.*

**The Concept:**

1. **Site (Rank 2):** Create `auditoria.nivopartners.com` (Vercel).
2. **Logic (Rank 1):** The site has a form where business owners put their URL.
3. **Automation:** n8n takes the URL -> Gemini Pro analyzes the site in 10 seconds -> Generates a PDF Report -> Agentic SDR sends it to their email + a link to book a call.

**Tools Used (All included/free):**

- **n8n:** Orchestration.
- **Gemini Pro (1.5/2.0):** Analysis and Script drafting.
- **Vercel:** Hosting the frontend.
- **Supabase:** Storing the lead data.
- **Resend:** Sending the automated results.
