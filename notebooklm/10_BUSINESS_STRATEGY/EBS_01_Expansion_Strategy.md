# 🚀 EBS 01: The "Elite 6" Automated Revenue Engine

**Version:** 2.0 (Post-Deep Research Refinement)
**Objective:** Focus ONLY on hyper-profitable, AI-native models for 2026. Avoid low-ticket "noise" and saturated markets.

---

## �️ The Survival Filter (Why the others were discarded)

We have removed models like *Job Boards, Digital Assets (Etsy), and General Newsletters*.
**Reason:** These now require high human labor/marketing spend or are being cannibalized by AI answer engines (Perplexity/ChatGPT). We only keep what scales with **Zero Marginal Cost** and **High Authority**.
