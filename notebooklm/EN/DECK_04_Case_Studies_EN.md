# 📊 DECK-04 — Case Studies: Nivo Partners Client Wins

**Use:** Sales calls and proposals — present after the client describes their situation.  
**Rule:** Never present a case study cold. First listen, then match it to the client's context.  
**Last updated:** Feb 2026

---

> [!TIP]
> Lead with the outcome numbers, not the process. The client cares about *"could this happen to us?"*, not *"how did you build it?"*

## 🌟 Case Study #1 — Sun Air Shades

**Industry:** Home exterior products (solar shades, blinds, pergolas)  
**Location:** South Florida  
**Nivo Ecosystem Deployed:** Revenue Engine (Website + Google Ads)  
**Timeline:** 4 weeks from kickoff to first lead

---

### The Situation

Sun Air Shades was running their business entirely through referrals and word-of-mouth. They had:

- No website presence
- Zero paid advertising
- No way to capture leads outside of personal contacts
- A great product but no systematic acquisition channel

**The owner's exact concern:** *"I don't know where my next client is coming from."*

> — Founder, Sun Air Shades

### Why This Works as a Sales Tool

**When to use it:**

- Client is running entirely on referrals
- Client doesn't have a website or has one that doesn't convert
- Client is in a local service business (home services, contractors, clinics)

**What it proves:**

- Nivo can launch from zero in 4 weeks
- The system tracks results from day one
- AI + ads + site work as one unit, not three separate tools

## 📌 Permission & Confidentiality Protocol

Before using any client name or logo in sales materials:

1. Ask for explicit written permission (email is sufficient)
2. If declined, present as "a South Florida home services client" (anonymous)
3. Results and metrics can always be shared — only the name requires permission
4. Once 3 case studies are approved: create a formal Case Studies PDF for proposals
