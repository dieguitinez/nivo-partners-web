## Why This System Exists

Nivo Partners is not a traditional agency. We are a **revenue infrastructure firm** with proprietary methodology. To maintain consistency, quality, and scalability — and to allow any team member to operate at the same level of excellence — all our methodology, processes, and decisions are documented here.

**Three audiences for this system:**

| Audience | What they need from here |
|---|---|
| 🆕 New employee / contractor | Understand how Nivo works, what we do and how we do it |
| 💼 Sales team | Materials to present and close clients |
| ⚙️ Technical team | SOPs, checklists, and deployment methodology |
