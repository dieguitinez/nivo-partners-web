# 💲 DECK-07 — Pricing Guide: Nivo Partners Packages & Pricing

**Use:** Internal reference for quoting. Do NOT share this document directly with clients — present pricing verbally or in a personalized proposal built from this guide.  
**Last updated:** Feb 2026  
**Golden rule:** Never mention price before the client describes their situation. Price without context = guaranteed objection.

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are base prices. Every proposal is customized to the actual scope. If the client needs something outside the package, always quote it as an add-on. Never give away out-of-scope work.
