# 🗓️ ONBOARD-03 — Project Timeline: Realistic Expectations by Package

**Use:** Share timeline expectations in the kickoff call and reinforce in the first email after signing.  
**Rule:** Always present timelines as "working days from the moment we have all assets from you." This protects us from clients who disappear for 2 weeks then expect delivery tomorrow.  
**Last updated:** Feb 2026

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The timeline clock starts on the day the client submits ALL required assets — not on the day the contract is signed. Make this explicit in the kickoff call.

## ⏱️ Timeline by Package

### Core Unit — Target: 2–3 Weeks

| Week | Milestones |
|---|---|
| Week 1 | Kickoff call → Asset collection → Copy review → Wireframe design |
| Week 2 | Development → Kai chatbot training → Mobile QA → Internal testing |
| Week 3 | Client review → Revisions (up to 1 round) → DNS setup → Launch → Delivery call |

**What can extend this timeline:**

- Client delays in sending photos or copy
- Requested out-of-scope changes mid-build
- Brand guidelines that arrive incomplete
- DNS propagation (technical, up to 48h)

### Core Unit Pro — Target: 3 Weeks

Same flow as Core Unit, with 1 extra week for additional pages.

| Week | Milestones |
|---|---|
| Week 1 | Kickoff → Assets → Architecture of all pages → Wireframes |
| Week 2 | Full development of all pages → Kai integration → QA |
| Week 3 | Client review → Revisions → SEO basics → Launch → Delivery |

### Growth Reactor — Target: 4–6 Weeks

| Week | Milestones |
|---|---|
| Week 1 | Kickoff → Asset collection → Competitive keyword research |

**Note:** Campaign performance data typically stabilizes at week 3–4 after launch. Don't promise ROI before 60 days with real data.

## 📋 Milestones That Require Client Action

These are points where **the client must approve or deliver** before work can proceed. Missing these creates cascading delays.

| Milestone | Client action required | Maximum wait before escalation |
|---|---|---|
| Asset submission | Photos, copy, logins, brand guide | 5 business days after kickoff |
| Wireframe approval | Written sign-off (email is sufficient) | 3 business days |
| Revision round | Consolidated feedback (one email, all changes) | 3 business days |
| Domain/DNS approval | Technical access or DNS record confirmation | 2 business days |
| Launch approval | Final "go ahead" from client | 2 business days |

**Escalation script when client stalls:**
> *"We're at [milestone] and need your [asset/approval] to move forward. Every day we wait pushes the delivery date by one day. If we don't hear back by [date + 3 days], we'll schedule a 15-min check-in call to review."*
