# 📈 DECK-05 — ROI Walkthrough: How to Present ROI in 15 Minutes

**Use:** Sales calls, proposals, and follow-ups — when the client asks "what's the return?"  
**Rule:** Never present generic numbers. Always personalize with the client's own data.  
**Last updated:** Feb 2026

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ROI conversation is only effective AFTER the client has described their situation. If you present ROI before you've listened, the numbers feel made up. Earn the right to present ROI by diagnosing first.

## The 5-Step Framework (15 Minutes)

### Step 1 — Establish the Current State (3 min)

*Ask, don't tell. Get their numbers.*

Key questions:

- "How many leads do you get per month right now?"
- "What's your average sale value?"
- "What percentage of leads do you close?"
- "Where are those leads coming from — referrals, ads, organic?"

**You're looking for:** Monthly lead volume + close rate + average ticket

---

### Step 2 — Calculate Their Current Revenue Baseline (2 min)

```
Current Monthly Revenue from Leads:
  Leads/month × Close Rate × Average Ticket = Monthly Revenue

Example:
  10 leads × 30% close = 3 clients × $2,500 = $7,500/month
```

Say: *"So right now, this channel is generating about $7,500 per month for you. Does that feel right?"*

**Why this works:** They confirm their own number. Now the ROI conversation is real, not hypothetical.

### Step 3 — Project What Nivo Adds (5 min)

Show the conservative scenario:

```
WITH NIVO (Year 1 Conservative):
  New leads/month from Google Ads: +15–25 (based on local market data)
  Conversion rate from ads: 15–25% (qualified intent)
  New clients/month: 3–6

  Additional Monthly Revenue: 3 × $2,500 = $7,500/month (conservative)
  Additional Annual Revenue: $90,000
```

Key phrases:

- *"This is the conservative scenario — based on similar clients in your market."*
- *"We don't control Google, but we control the targeting, the copy, and the landing experience. Those are the levers we optimize."*

---

### Step 4 — Show the Investment vs. Return (3 min)

```
INVESTMENT (Year 1):
  Setup fee:           $6,500 (one-time)
  Management (12mo):  $1,200 × 12 = $14,400
  Ad spend (12mo):     $800 × 12 = $9,600 (client's own, goes directly to Google)
  Total Year 1:        $30,500

RETURN (Conservative):
  Additional annual revenue: $90,000

  ROI = ($90,000 - $20,900*) / $20,900 = 330%
  * Excluding ad spend which generates revenue directly
```

Say: *"Even in the conservative scenario, the system pays for itself in the second month. After that, it's compounding."*

---

### Step 5 — Reframe the Risk (2 min)

If the client hesitates on the investment:

*"The risk isn't spending $6,500. The risk is staying at $7,500/month when the data shows you could be at $15,000. Every month you wait has a cost too."*

Final close question: *"What would it mean for your business to add 5 new clients per month consistently?"*

Let them answer. Don't fill the silence.

## ROI by Ecosystem

### Digital Authority (Core Unit)

- Primary ROI driver: Lead capture efficiency, brand credibility
- ROI timeline: 60–90 days (brand trust builds slowly)
- Measurable: Leads generated, chat interactions, form submissions

### Revenue Engine (Growth Reactor)

- Primary ROI driver: Paid acquisition — fastest path to measurable return
- ROI timeline: 30–60 days from first campaign launch
- Measurable: ROAS, cost per lead, conversion rate, revenue attributed to ads

### Intelligent Ecosystem (Sovereign)

- Primary ROI driver: Automation replacing manual processes
- ROI timeline: 90–180 days (systems need calibration)
- Measurable: Hours of manual work eliminated, leads followed up automatically, response time

## Common Objections During the ROI Conversation

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "These numbers seem high" | "That's why I only showed the conservative scenario. Let me show you the baseline one, which is even more conservative." |
| "I know a guy who spent $10k on ads and got nothing" | "The ads aren't the problem — the strategy, targeting, and landing experience are. That's what we control and what we optimize." |
| "I can't afford the setup fee right now" | "What's the cost of not having it? If you close 2 extra clients per month, you recover the setup in 30 days." |
| "I need to think about it" | "Absolutely. What specifically would you need to see to feel confident?" |
