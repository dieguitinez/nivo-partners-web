# ⚖️ GOV_02 — Operational Statutes & Firm Governance

**Nivo Partners** | *Operations & Decision Framework*
**Version:** 1.0 (Feb 2026)

---

## 1. Decision Structure & Identity (The Hierarchy)

To operate as a "well-constituted" company, Nivo Partners is governed by a structure based on **System Architects**, rather than traditional administrative hierarchies.

### 1.1. The Principal Architect (CEO/Owner)

Ultimately responsible for the strategic vision, high-level alliances, and the custody of the proprietary methodology. Holds veto power over any project that poses a risk to the firm's technical reputation.

### 1.2. The Operations Node

Tasked with the daily execution of the 3 Pillars (Digital, Revenue, Intelligent). Their mission is to ensure compliance with the SOPs documented in the **Organizational Knowledge System (OKS)**.

## 2. Partnership Laws

Nivo Partners does not accept every client. We operate under the law of **Positive Filtering**. A partner must meet the Ideal Partner Profile (IPP):

1. **Ownership Mindset:** Must understand and value sovereignty over their data and infrastructure.
2. **Data Transparency:** Must allow full access to billing metrics and CRM so the Nivo engine can optimize results.
3. **Investment Commitment:** Understands that infrastructure is engineered, not improvised.

> **Golden Rule:** Nivo Partners reserves the right to disconnect the infrastructure of any partner who violates the firm's ethical or compliance laws (Spam, Fraud, IP Infringement).

---

## 3. Intellectual Property Protocols

Nivo Partners operates under the principle of **Hybrid Sovereignty**:

* **Client Infrastructure:** Code, databases, and domains reside in client-owned accounts (Vercel, Supabase, Cloudflare). The client holds absolute sovereignty over their property.
* **Nivo Engines:** Proprietary lead analysis algorithms, neural integration, and custom dashboards are the intellectual property of Nivo Partners and are delivered under a perpetual use license as long as the infrastructure is utilized.
* **GitHub Management:** All development is managed in GitHub organizations owned by the client, with Nivo Partners as the primary collaborator.

## 4. Governance Cadence (Meeting & Sync Laws)

To ensure institutional health, the firm follows a strict cadence:

1. **Architecture Sync (Weekly):** Review of server health, APIs, and lead status for every active project.
2. **Quarterly Strategy Audit:** Deep dive review of statutes and update of **GOV_04 — Strategic Roadmap**.
3. **AI Ethics Council:** Ad-hoc session to evaluate new AI models or tools before integrating them into client infrastructure.

---

## 5. Growth & Scale Philosophy

Nivo Partners scales through **Modularity**. We do not seek an army of employees, but rather an ecosystem of **Senior Architects** and highly specialized **AI Agents** operating under these statutes.
