# 🤖 GOV_03 — Ethical AI & Data Sovereignty Charter

**Nivo Partners** | *Institutional Commitment on Artificial Intelligence*
**Version:** 1.0 (Feb 2026)

## 1. The Non-Exploitation Principle (Data Integrity)

At Nivo Partners, we treat our partners' information as a sacred asset. We recognize that in the AI era, data is the fuel for market dominance. Therefore:

* **Model Isolation:** A Partner's training data, chat logs, and lead information will **NEVER** be used to improve, train, or fine-tune models shared with other partners or competitors.
* **Weight Ownership:** If model fine-tuning is performed for a specific client, the resulting weights or adapter (LoRA) belong exclusively to the client or are encapsulated within their sovereign architecture.

## 2. Algorithmic Transparency (The "Kai" Rule)

Artificial Intelligence at Nivo Partners (including our lead agent, Kai) operates under the principle of **Operational Transparency**:

1. **Clear Identification:** The end user must always know if they are interacting with an AI agent or a human architect. We do not permit "Neural Ghosting" (pretending an AI is human to deceive).
2. **Explainability:** All our bots and agents must be able to explain the source of their knowledge when requested (linking back to the loaded knowledge base).
3. **Human-in-the-loop:** No AI action at Nivo Partners with direct legal or financial impact (e.g., closing a contract or disposing of funds) is executed without final validation from an authorized human from the Partner.

## 3. Privacy-by-Design Architecture (FIPA Compliance)

Nivo Partners strictly adheres to the **Florida Information Protection Act (FIPA)**. Our AI is no exception:

* **Proactive Anonymization:** Before sending data to external LLMs (such as Gemini or OpenAI) for bulk processing, we apply PII (Personally Identifiable Information) scrubbing protocols where context allows.
* **Encryption at Rest:** Data stored for agents' long-term memory (Vector Databases) is encrypted with keys managed within the client's environment.

---

## 4. Continuous Audit

We commit to quarterly internal audits of our prompts and logic flows to ensure that no biases harmful to the Partner's business or the firm's ethics are introduced.
