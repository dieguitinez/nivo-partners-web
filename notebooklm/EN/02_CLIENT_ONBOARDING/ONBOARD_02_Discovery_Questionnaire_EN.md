> [!IMPORTANT]
> This questionnaire is NOT shared with the client. It's your conversation guide. The client should feel like it's a conversation, not an interview. Take notes in parallel.

## Phase 1 — Business Context *(5 min)*

The goal is to understand the business before talking about solutions.

| # | Question | What you're listening for |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | *"Tell me in your own words what your business does and who you serve."* | Clarity of value proposition, implied average ticket |
| 1.2 | *"How long have you been operating, and how have you gotten clients so far?"* | Business maturity, main acquisition channel |
| 1.3 | *"What's the average ticket for your typical service or project?"* | Qualifies if they meet the >$2,000 criterion |
| 1.4 | *"How many new clients do you close per month currently?"* | Baseline volume → how much room for improvement |

**🚩 Red Flag:** If average ticket is <$1,500 or they say "I just need something basic" → not a Nivo client. Close with respect: *"I think there are more appropriate solutions for your current stage."*

---

## Phase 2 — Digital Diagnosis *(10 min)*

Identify the real pain before mentioning any service.

| # | Question | What you're listening for |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | *"Do you have a website? When was the last time it was updated?"* | Urgency of renewal, previous investment |
| 2.2 | *"When someone searches for you on Google today, what do they find?"* | Awareness of gap between perception and reality |
| 2.3 | *"How many leads come to you from the internet per month, approximately?"* | Quantifies the digital acquisition problem |
| 2.4 | *"Are you investing in paid advertising (Google Ads, Meta)? How has that been going?"* | History with ads: if they failed, why → opportunity for Division II |
| 2.5 | *"Do you have any client tracking system (CRM)? How do you follow up with leads who don't close right away?"* | Identifies opportunity for Division III (automation) |

**Internal note:** If they answer "no updated website" + "no leads coming in" + "no follow-up system" → ideal client for Sovereign ($12.5k+) down the road. Start with Core Unit and build the path.

---

## Phase 3 — Goals and Expectations *(8 min)*

Here you understand what they want to achieve and by when.

| # | Question | What you're listening for |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | *"If we worked together and in 6 months you looked back, what would need to have happened for you to say 'this was worth it'?"* | Their definition of success → anchors the proposal to that outcome |
| 3.2 | *"Is there a competitor or business you admire for their digital presence? What do you like about them?"* | Visual/aspirational reference |
| 3.3 | *"Do you have any upcoming deadline or event that needs this ready by?"* | Real urgency → can accelerate the close or signal unrealistic pressure |
| 3.4 | *"Is there anyone else on your team involved in this decision?"* | Identifies whether there's a second decision maker → don't close without them present |

---

## Phase 4 — Investment Context *(5 min)*

Never ask about price directly. Use these questions to qualify investment capacity.

| # | Question | What you're listening for |
|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | *"Have you worked with agencies or freelancers before? How was that experience?"* | If they had a bad experience, LISTEN. That defines your differentiators in the proposal |
| 4.2 | *"How much are you currently investing in marketing or digital presence per month?"* | Reference anchor to propose higher investment with ROI |
| 4.3 | *"Do you have a defined budget for this project, or is it flexible based on expected ROI?"* | If they name a very low number (<$2k) → reconsider. If they say "depends on the value" → ideal client |

**🚩 Red Flag:** If they already spent $500 on someone and it went badly → educatable. If they already spent $5k and it went badly → they need strong evidence (Sun Air Shades case study).

---

## Phase 5 — Closing the Diagnosis *(5 min)*

Never end the call without a concrete next step.

**What you say:**

> *"Based on what you shared with me, I can clearly see the type of infrastructure that would make the most sense for your business. I'm going to prepare a personalized proposal in the next few days that includes exactly what we'd build, what the process would look like, and what the investment would be. Do you have availability on [specific date] to review it together?"*

**Closing rules:**

- Always schedule the next call BEFORE hanging up
- If they can't schedule now → *"Can I message you with 2-3 time options?"*
- Never send the proposal by email without a call to present it
