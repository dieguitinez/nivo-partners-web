# 🛡️ Objection Handling Guide — Nivo Partners

**Use:** During sales calls or during proposal presentations
**Golden rule:** Never argue. Reframe. An objection is information, not rejection.

---

> [!TIP]
> 80% of closes happen after the 5th interaction. The first objection is not a "no" — it's a request for more information or trust. Your job is to provide that.

## The Top 10 Objections

---

### 🔴 Objection 1: "It's too expensive" / "I don't have that budget"

**What they're really saying:** *I don't see enough value yet to justify that number.*

**Response:**

> *"I completely understand. Let me ask you this — if we brought in 3 additional clients per month through this system, what would that represent in revenue for your business?"*

*(Let them do the math. Then:)*

> *"So we're talking about [Xk]/month in new revenue. The investment of [proposal] pays itself back in [N] weeks. The real question isn't whether you can afford it — it's whether you can afford not to have it."*

**If they persist:**
> *"Is there an investment level that feels more comfortable right now? We can explore starting with the Core Unit and scaling based on results."*

---

### 🔴 Objection 2: "Let me think about it" / "Give me some time"

**What they're really saying:** *I'm not 100% convinced, or there's something I didn't say.*

**Response:**

> *"Of course, it's an important decision. To help you think — what specific information do you feel you're missing to feel ready to make a decision?"*

*(Listen. Whatever they say is the real blocker.)*

**If they don't specify:**
> *"What I often find is that when someone needs more time, there's a concern that didn't surface in our conversation. Is there something specific we haven't covered?"*

**Rule:** Never end a call with "I'll think about it" without a concrete next step. *"Can we talk on [specific date] to see where you landed?"*

---

### 🔴 Objection 3: "I need to check with my partner/wife/team"

**What they're really saying:** *I'm not the only decision maker — or I don't feel confident deciding alone.*

**Response:**

> *"Absolutely, decisions of this nature are made as a team. Would it make sense to schedule a quick call where both of you are present so I can answer their questions directly?"*

**If they say "I'll tell them":**
> *"Perfect. To help you present it — what do you think would be your partner's main questions or concerns?"*

*(This lets you handle the absent person's objections through them.)*

---

### 🔴 Objection 4: "I tried an agency before and it didn't work"

**What they're really saying:** *I'm afraid of wasting money again.*

**Response:**

> *"That's exactly why most of our clients come to us. Tell me — what happened? What did they promise and what did they actually deliver?"*

*(Listen completely. Then:)*

> *"What you're describing is the classic traditional agency model: they charge for time, not results. The difference with Nivo is that we install infrastructure that belongs to you. If we stop working together tomorrow, the system keeps running. [Name], do you have the code for your current site? Is the domain in your name?"*

*(If they say "I don't know" or "no" → you just earned instant credibility by asking the question nobody else asked.)*

---

### 🔴 Objection 5: "I can do this myself / I have a nephew who knows about this"

**What they're really saying:** *I don't understand why it's worth what it costs.*

**Response:**

> *"Absolutely you can. Many businesses start that way. The question is: what's the opportunity cost of your time? How much is one hour of your time worth inside your business?"*

*(Let them answer. Then:)*

> *"If building this takes 80-120 hours, and your hour is worth [X], the true cost of doing it yourself is [Y]. Plus, you'd need to learn high-conversion marketing, technical SEO, and systems architecture. We already have that accumulated knowledge."*

**If they mention the nephew:**
> *"That's a valid option. What I'd ask is this: before you start, ask them 3 questions: What's been the ROI on the last sites they built? Do they have experience measuring conversion? Who's accountable if results don't come? The problem with unspecialized talent isn't capability — it's accountability."*

---

### 🔴 Objection 6: "I'm not sure this works for my industry"

**What they're really saying:** *Give me relevant social proof.*

**Response:**

> *"That's a valid question. Tell me — what specifically about your industry do you think wouldn't apply?"*

*(Listen. Almost always the principle is universal: traffic → conversion → retention.)*

> *"What we've found is that the engineering behind client acquisition systems works the same in [spa] as in [HVAC]. The customer searching Google for 'best [your service] in [city]' has predictable behavior. Our job is to be there with the right offer at the right moment."*

**If there's a relevant case study:**
> *"We worked with Sun Air Shades, a Smart Home contractor in Florida. We increased their leads from 40 to 65/month in 90 days. The principle is the same."*

---

### 🔴 Objection 7: "What guarantees do you offer?"

**What they're really saying:** *I need to reduce my perceived risk.*

**Response:**

> *"That's the right question. I'll be direct: we don't guarantee specific results because marketing involves variables outside our control — the market, competition, your ability to close. What we do guarantee: we deliver what we promise, on the timeline we agreed on. And if something isn't working, we adjust it at no additional cost during the first 30 days post-launch."*

> *"What I can tell you is this: everything we build is yours. If you decide you don't want to continue working with us, you keep everything: the code, the domain, the campaigns. There's no dependency on us."*

---

### 🔴 Objection 8: "Now isn't a good time" / "We're in a slow season"

**What they're really saying:** *The timing doesn't feel right, or there's fear about investing now.*

**Response:**

> *"Interesting — most of our clients who have grown the most started precisely during their slow season. Why? Because when the busy season came, they already had the system ready capturing leads. Those who waited until busy season to build... had to wait for the next one to see results."*

> *"When does your busy season start? [Date]. That gives us exactly [X weeks] to build, launch, and optimize before your demand peak arrives."*

---

### 🔴 Objection 9: "Why Nivo and not [competitor]?"

**What they're really saying:** *I'm comparing options. Convince me you're the best fit.*

**Response:**

> *"Good question. Can I ask what you saw from them that caught your attention?"*

*(Listen. Then contrast specifically on the points they mentioned.)*

> *"There are a few key differences. The first is ownership: when we build something for you, it's yours. No licenses, no dependency. The second is methodology: we don't sell templates. Everything we build is custom to your specific business. The third is transparency: you'll have access to everything — code, metrics, campaigns. No black boxes."*

**Rule:** Never speak badly about a competitor by name. Contrast on principles, not personalities.

---

### 🔴 Objection 10: "I need to see results before committing more"

**What they're really saying:** *Give me a low-risk entry point.*

**Response:**

> *"That makes complete sense. You know what? That's exactly why we have the Core Unit — it's precisely that: the lowest-risk entry with maximum immediate impact. We start there, you see results, then you decide whether it makes sense to expand to the next level. Want to look at what that would specifically include for your business?"*

---

## Objection Handling Principles

1. **Listen, don't react.** Let them finish speaking completely before responding.
2. **Validate first.** Always start with *"I understand"* or *"That's a valid question"* — never with a defensive argument.
3. **Reframe the problem.** The price objection is always a question about value.
4. **Use silence.** After asking a question, stop talking. The first one to speak, loses.
5. **Never close on "I'll think about it."** There's always a concrete next step.
