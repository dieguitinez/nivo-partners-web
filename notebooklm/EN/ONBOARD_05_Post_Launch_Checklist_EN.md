# ✅ ONBOARD-05 — Post-Launch Checklist: Everything Before Closing a Project

**Use:** Run this checklist before every project is marked "delivered" and before any retainer begins.  
**Owner:** Founding Partner / Project Lead  
**Last updated:** Feb 2026

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not schedule the delivery call until all items in Sections 1 and 2 of this checklist are complete. Delivering an incomplete project creates support debt that is ten times harder to resolve after handover.

## Section 4 — Delivery Call Agenda (45–60 min)

**Goal:** Client walks away confident, not confused.

1. **Open** (5 min) — Congratulate them. Frame the call as a celebration + walkthrough, not a tutorial.
2. **Live walkthrough** (15 min) — Screen share the site from the client's device if possible. Walk through each section from the user's perspective.
3. **Analytics demo** (10 min) — Show the GA4 dashboard. Show a test lead in Supabase. Make the data tangible.
4. **Access confirmation** (10 min) — Log in to each platform together and confirm they have independent access.
5. **What happens next** (10 min) — Explain the 30-day support window, how to reach us, what's not included.
6. **Q&A + next steps** (10 min) — Answer questions. If they mention scope additions, acknowledge them for the add-on quote queue.
